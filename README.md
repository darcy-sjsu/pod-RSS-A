## Deployment

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

**Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.**

1. Use the docker-compose configuration file, modify environment variables according to your needs
```yml
services:
  pigeon-pod:
    build: .
    image: 'pigeon-pod:latest'
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: pigeon-pod
    ports:
      - '8834:8080'
    environment:
      - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:sqlite:/data/pigeon-pod.db # set to your database path
      # Optional: disable PigeonPod built-in auth when running behind another auth layer
      # - PIGEON_AUTH_ENABLED=false
    volumes:
      - data:/data

volumes:
  data:
```

> [!WARNING]
> `PIGEON_AUTH_ENABLED` defaults to `true`. Set it to `false` only if another trusted layer already protects the web UI, such as an auth proxy, reverse proxy access control, VPN, or private network.
>
> If you disable built-in auth, you must secure PigeonPod by other means. Do not expose an auth-disabled instance directly to the public Internet.

2. Start the service
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the application
Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8834` with **default username: `root` and default password: `Root@123`**

### Run with JAR

**Make sure you have Java 17+ and yt-dlp installed on your machine.**

1. Build the JAR from source, see [Local Development](#local-development)

2. Create data directory in the same directory as the JAR file.
```bash
mkdir -p data
```

3. Run the application
```bash
java -jar -Dspring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/your/pigeon-pod.db \  # set to your database path
           pigeon-pod-x.x.x.jar
```

4. Access the application
Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080` with **default username: `root` and default password: `Root@123`**


## Storage Configuration

- PigeonPod supports `LOCAL` and `S3` storage modes.
- You can only enable one mode at a time.
- S3 mode supports MinIO, Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, and other S3-compatible services.
- Switching storage mode does not migrate historical media automatically. You must migrate files manually.

### Storage Quick Comparison

| Mode | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOCAL` | Easy setup, no external dependency | Uses local disk, harder to scale |
| `S3` | Better scalability, suitable for cloud deployment | Requires object storage setup and credentials |
